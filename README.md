# Redemption Maps
This was a fun side project to parse data from the British Airways airmiles redemption
API and present a map of where the user could travel on a given date, in a given airline
cabin. 

This app was successful in providing functionality that didn't exist anywhere else at the
time. I gained access to their API by reverse-engineering their Android app, which hit unsecured
endpoints. However, British Airways tightened their API authentication and I lost access to the
data. 

For similar functionality (although you'll have to pay for it), I recommend [SeatSpy](https://www.seatspy.com/)
